#More indepth Summary of what I learned from each Project


**Billulator**
So this project was my very first project I pushed to github. Unfortunately, it didn't push everything into it as I had alot of trouble utilizing github my very first time. There were arbitrary merge conflicts as that happens with new beginnings. I took pride in my first look at the swift language and the first usage of storyboard with Xcode. This was also my acceptance project to Code Path. This project took 12 hours. I learned alittle about Git, Swift Syntax and the click and drag using story board.

**ReelCheck**

In ReelCheck, this was the very first time I had the opportunity to use APIs and using multiple View Controllers and what not. It was my opportunity to use tables and Custom Cells. I used cocoapods for AFNetworking. This utilized imdb's database which has data wrapped in JSON. I also learned from my git mistake from my last project. This time it pushed correctly with a correct gitignore file. Also I am getting used to using the terminal here.

**AirUiOSed**

So, this is at the Cornell Data Science Hackathon where I finally get to use my new skillset to do something useful. I helped with frontend web development and since there was time and members on my team, I decided to help the team by creating a iOS app alongside the frontend app. Since the web app uses google maps and a few APIs such as Uber and scrapped data from AIRBNB. I managed to implement the placepicker and the Map API. It was a great learning experience however I was disappointed in the fact that I could not finish integrating the uber api into it. 

**ReelCheck Version 2**

ReelCheck V2 was made so I learned about having multiple View controllers and how to manage it using the Navigation Controller. I also got to manage tabs which was extremely useful. I managed to pull the images and also add scroll views.
**YelpApp**
I managed to use autolayout for the first time. Pulled Yelp data from Yelp API
**Twitter**
Learned about Networking and Authencation for the first time. Learned OAuth.
